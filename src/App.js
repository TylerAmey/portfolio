Teams are able to request QR Code presets that populate through Brandfolder's API (a data asset management platform) if they will have recurring use cases for their QR Codes. One time users are also able to insert their own images if their team doesn't require a preset. This website has language translation capability, limited customization (to maintain brand standards), and offers accessability options through the 'printing guidelines' button and the color selection. I am the sole developer on the project, and I am currently in the process of securing the site with Azure authentication and key vaults." },

Over my 10 weeks with the team, I created over 70 intranet pages using SharePoint. Along with the pages, I created a PowerApp to display their team members, a PowerBI application to display audit analytics, and used Photoshop to design graphics for their homepage. During this process I was tasked with organizing meetings throughout our branch and various parts of the company as well as user testing with employees. My work on this site was received very well and went on to be used throughout other facets of the company, where various assets and templates of mine were used throughout Moog's intranet." },

Above, is an example of one of my info graphs that I developed for one of the team's surveys. Unfortunately due to several restructures within the team, work was limited and projects had often gotten scrapped. However this was a great learning opportunity and taught me to be flexible and responsive in work environments." },

These actions are based off of the strength of the CPU's hand, player actions, and a 'bluff' factor. The player is given various options to act on including bet sizing based on real poker standards. The most impressive part of the development was creating the algorithm for the CPU to play off of, and the CPU often makes fantastic decisions. The app heavily utilizes plist and sort functions to determine players hands to utilize within the algorithm." },
